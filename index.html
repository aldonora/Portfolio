  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I am a final year Mechanical Engineering student with a strong passion for fluid dynamics, 3D printing, and solving engineering problems through data-driven analysis. I’ve always been fascinated by the behavior of fluids, particularly air and how it shapes real-world systems. This sparked my curiosity to actually study this phenomenon in depth, giving rise to my final year project which sought to integrate 3D printing, computer aided design, and CFD simulations using ANSYS Fluent to explore aeroelastic flutter in small-scale aerofoils. I also have experience creating functional 3D models through my personal 3D printing hobby.</p>
